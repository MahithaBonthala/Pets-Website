				<li class="popup__item">
					<h1>Bathing:</h1>
				</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Use pet-friendly products: Choose a mild shampoo specifically formulated for pets. Human shampoos can be too harsh and may irritate their skin.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Prepare the bathing area: Before starting the bath, gather all the necessary supplies, such as towels, shampoo, and a non-slip mat. Ensure the water temperature is lukewarm, not too hot or cold.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Rinse thoroughly: Wet your pet's fur completely, and then apply the shampoo. Gently massage it into their coat, avoiding the eyes and ears. Rinse thoroughly to remove all the shampoo residue.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Dry properly: After the bath, use a towel to blot excess moisture from your pet's fur. If they tolerate it, you can also use a pet dryer on a low heat setting, keeping it at a safe distance to prevent overheating.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">
					<h1>Nail Trimming:</h1>
				</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Use proper nail clippers: Invest in a pair of pet nail clippers that are specifically designed for the size and type of your pet's nails. Scissor-style or guillotine-style clippers are commonly used.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Be cautious and gradual: Start by trimming a small portion of the nail, avoiding the quick (the sensitive part containing blood vessels). If your pet has dark nails and you can't see the quick, trim small amounts at a time to avoid accidentally cutting too far.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Take breaks if needed: If your pet becomes anxious or restless, take breaks during the nail trimming session. Offer treats and positive reinforcement to make the experience more pleasant.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Consider professional help if necessary: If you're uncomfortable or unsure about trimming your pet's nails, consult a professional groomer or your veterinarian. They can demonstrate the proper technique or handle the task for you.</li>
				<li class="popup__item">Remember, grooming should be a positive experience for both you and your pet. Take it slowly, be patient, and rewardyour pet with treats and praise to create a bond of trust and make grooming a pleasant routine.</li>
